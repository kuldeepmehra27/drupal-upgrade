## Why drupal upgrade required? ##

Drupal upgrades are required for several reasons, including:

**Security:** Drupal upgrades often include important security patches and improvements, which help to protect your site against vulnerabilities and attacks. As new security risks are identified, the Drupal community works to release updates and patches to address them.

**Bug fixes:** Upgrading Drupal can help to fix bugs and issues that have been discovered in previous versions. This can improve the stability and reliability of your site, and help to prevent issues from occurring in the future.

**New features and functionality:** Drupal upgrades can introduce new features and functionality that can improve the performance, usability, and functionality of your site. For example, upgrades might introduce improvements to the user interface, new content management tools, or improved performance.

**Compatibility:** Upgrading Drupal can ensure that your site is compatible with the latest versions of PHP and other server software. This can help to ensure that your site runs smoothly and without errors, and that you are able to take advantage of the latest features and improvements in the underlying technology.

**Long-term support:** Upgrading Drupal is necessary for receiving long-term support from the Drupal community. Drupal versions typically have a limited lifespan of active support and security updates, so upgrading to newer versions is necessary to ensure that your site remains secure and supported.

In summary, Drupal upgrades are important for security, bug fixes, new features and functionality, compatibility, and long-term support. By keeping your Drupal site up-to-date, you can help to ensure that it remains secure, reliable, and functional for your users.
